## Getting Started
Install dependenices separately in project file, server and client folders.

### Project file
- Install dependencies: `npm i`

### Server folder

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - PORT: 8000

  - Database
    - username: `labber` 
    - password: `labber` 
    - database: `skinfax`

  - CLOUDINARY API
    - CLOUDINARY_URL
    - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
    - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
    - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
  
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm start`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8000/`

### Client folder
1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Run the client: `npm start`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
